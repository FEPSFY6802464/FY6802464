      This article seeks to outline the fundamental ideas of knot theory, the topological study of mathematical knots, 
      first by explaining the basic assumptions of knot theory and then by discussing the concepts of equivalence and knot composition. 
      It will also include a brief exploration of knot invariants however due to the introductory nature of the article; an explanation 
      of polynomial knot invariants will not be included.

      A basic definition of a mathematical knot is a continuous simple closed curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space, R^3. (Livingston, 1996) 
      As such it can be described as an embedding of a circle in R^3. (Kawauchi, 1996) In order to avoid unnecessary complication, infinitely 
      looping knots, known as “wild knots” (see figure 1), can be excluded so that only those knots which can be represented using polygonal 
      curves (which are inherently finite) are considered. (Livingston, 1996) It is also important to limit deformations of knots to being 
      ‘ambient isotopies’, which disallows shrinking any part of the knot into a point in order to eliminate the knot. (Adams, 1994)

      The most rudimentary mathematical knot is an unknotted circle, known as the unknot or trivial knot, with the next most rudimentary
      being the trefoil, (Adams, 1994) which can be displayed using knot diagrams (see figure 2); two-dimensional projections of a given 
      knot with crossings represented by broken arcs. (Yetter, 2001) Any knot can be deformed into different projections but is still the 
      same knot (Adams, 1994), for instance, two knots known as ‘Perko’s pair’ (see figure 3) were long thought to be different knots but 
      could in fact be changed into one another by a finite series of deformations (Murasugi, 1996), therefore any two knots can be said to 
      be equivalent if they are related by a finite sequence of such deformations known as ‘Reidemeister moves’. (Yetter, 2001) These 
      ‘Reidemeister moves’(see figure 4) consist of: type I moves, twisting or untwisting a section of the knot; type II moves, moving one 
      section over another; and type III moves, Moving a section over or under a crossing. (Lickorish, 1997)

      One technique for creating new knots is by taking two existing knots, removing an arc from each knot and conjoining the ends, 
      the resulting knot is called a ‘composite knot’. (Adams, 1994) In a similar vein, knots which cannot be decomposed into any 2 
      existing nontrivial knots are called ‘prime knots’ (Livingston, 1993) These ‘prime knots’ are equivalent to arithmetic prime 
      numbers and thus any knot can be decomposed into a finite number of prime knots. (Murasugi, 1996) Prime knots have been of particular 
      interest to knot theorists due to their uniqueness (Adams, 1994) and as such many tabulations of these knots, usually ordered by the 
      number of crossings, into tables exist (see figure 5). So far, all prime knots up to 16 crossings have been tabulated, with around 1.7 
      million known prime knots. (Hoste et al, 1998)

      The subject of knot theory also includes the study of links (Livingston, 1993), which are collections of loops that are knotted together 
      but which do not intersect. (Murasugi, 1996) Just like with knots if 2 projections of a link are equivalent, they are related by a finite 
      sequence of Reidemeister moves. (Adams, 1994) One link of interest is the so-called ‘Borromean link’ (see figure 7), whose links cannot be 
      separated by deformation, but if one of the component loops is removed the other 2 split apart. (Livingston, 1993) These such links are called 
      ‘Brunnian’ links. (Livingston, 1993)

      An important tool in knot theory is that of ‘knot invariants’ (Kawauchi, 1996), quantities which are the same between equivalent knots. 
      (Purcell, 2020) Furthermore, for a quantity to be a knot invariant it must not change when performing the elementary knot moves on its 
      associated knot. (Murasugi, 1996) One relatively simple knot invariant is the crossing number of a knot: the least number of crossings of 
      any projection of a knot (Lickorish, 1997). For instance, referring back to figure 5, knots 7(1) to 7(7) are related by sharing the same 
      crossing number of 7. A knot’s crossing number can be determined by taking a projection of a knot, K, with a number of crossings n. From 
      this it is known that the knot has n crossings or less. Therefore, if the list of all knots with fewer crossings than n is known, and knot
      k does not appear on that list, it must have n crossings. (Adams, 1994) One problem in knot theory is determining the difference in complexity
      between a given knot and the unknot (Kawauchi, 1996), for this it is useful to use a knot invariant called the ‘unknotting number’. We can do 
      this by taking a diagram of a nontrivial knot and swapping the over-crossing and under-crossing segments at several crossing points until we 
      are left with the unknot (see figure 8). (Murasugi, 1996) Thus the unknotting number of any given projection of a knot is the least number of 
      crossings that would have to be changed to create the unknot. (Adams, 1994) Another useful knot invariant is that of the ‘bridge number’. 
      Taking a projection of a knot, arcs that go over at least one crossing but not under any crossing are called ‘overpasses’ (Adams, 1994). 
      Furthermore, such ‘overpasses’ which cannot be made any longer are called ‘maximal overpasses’ (Adams,1994). For a given projection of a knot 
      the number of ‘maximal overpasses’ is called the ‘bridge number’ (Murasugi, 1996)
